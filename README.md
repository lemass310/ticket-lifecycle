As the Admin assign each ticket to the Agents and select the appropriate ticket severity, for example: 

Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7) [entire mobile/online banking system is down] -> Assign to System Admins

Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) [accounting department needs adobe upgrade, broken] -> Jane Doe

Sev-B/C (2 hours, business hours) [CFO’s laptop seems a bit slow] -> John Doe
